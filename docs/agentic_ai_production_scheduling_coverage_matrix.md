## 7) Overall Conclusion

Current implementation is **substantial but not complete** relative to the full requirement document.

- **Strongly implemented**: event ingestion reliability, event-driven recommendation lifecycle, approval/publish guardrails, schedule versioning/compare, and P2 orchestration simulation enrichments.
- **Partially implemented**: deeper constraint solver capabilities (beyond current policy catalog), formalized multi-agent runtime decomposition, and enterprise-grade observability/compliance envelope.
- **Missing**: some roadmap-level capabilities (e.g., richer simulation UX/workbench depth and advanced optimization depth).

## 8) Recommended Next Slice (P2 -> P3 Bridge)

1. Extend the constraint catalog beyond current machine-eligibility/alternate-routing coverage (labor skill, setup matrix) with explicit validation chain.
2. Expand simulation features with scenario cataloging, richer compare semantics, and UI drill-down over persisted runs.
3. Expand audit breadth from recommendation-centric traces to broader cross-domain audit views and UI drill-downs.
4. Expand UI to display **objective weights, risk indicators, and simulation alternatives** explicitly in control tower/recommendation panels.
