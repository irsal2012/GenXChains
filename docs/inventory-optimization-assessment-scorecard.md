# Inventory Optimization Assessment & Executive Scorecard

This document helps teams quickly evaluate whether current inventory settings are truly optimized or mostly static defaults, and gives a 1-page scorecard format for S&OP reviews.

## 1) IMS data vs optimization (important distinction)

In most organizations, inventory data is extracted from IMS/ERP/WMS platforms. These systems are usually strong at **recording and executing transactions** (on-hand, in-transit, allocations, receipts/issues), but are often weaker at **continuous inventory optimization**.

- **IMS/ERP/WMS = system of record + execution**
  - What stock you have now
  - What moved
  - What is allocated / in transit
- **Planning optimization (GenXChains) = decision intelligence**
  - What stock you should hold
  - Why policy should change
  - Service/cost/risk trade-offs across scenarios

> Practical conclusion: inventory master data often comes from IMS, but optimization still needs planning logic and governance to avoid overstock/stockout outcomes.

## 2) Inventory Optimization Diagnostic (15 checks)

Use the checklist below as a rapid maturity scan.

### A. Policy Logic (3 checks)

1. Safety stock is recalculated using demand and lead-time variability (not static constants).
2. Reorder points are dynamically updated on a recurring cadence.
3. Service level targets are segmented (e.g., A/B/C, strategic vs non-strategic items).

### B. Forecast Integration (3 checks)

4. Forecast error (bias/variance/MAPE) is used in policy calculation.
5. Promotions/seasonality are reflected in policy updates.
6. Consensus/approved demand plan feeds inventory policy (not only historical averages).

### C. Supply Constraints (3 checks)

7. Lead-time distributions are tracked by supplier/lane (not only single values).
8. MOQ, lot size, case-pack, and similar constraints are built into recommendations.
9. Supplier reliability/risk is reflected in buffers or replenishment logic.

### D. Governance & Cadence (3 checks)

10. Inventory policy is reviewed in a fixed cadence (e.g., monthly S&OP/IBP cycle).
11. Policy changes follow approval workflow (planner → manager/lead).
12. Policy changes are auditable with ownership and timestamps.

### E. Outcome KPIs (3 checks)

13. Service level/fill rate improves while turns are stable or improving.
14. Stockouts/backorders/expedites trend downward.
15. Excess/obsolete inventory and cash tied in inventory trend downward.

## 3) Scoring bands

Add 1 point for each “Yes”.

- **0–5 Yes** → **Level 1: Transactional / static settings**
- **6–11 Yes** → **Level 2: Partial optimization**
- **12–15 Yes** → **Level 3: Mature optimization foundation**

## 4) One-page executive traffic-light scorecard (S&OP)

Use this in monthly S&OP forums.

| Area | Score (0–3) | RAG | Key Observation | Decision Needed | Owner | Due Date |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| Policy Logic |  | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |  |  |  |  |
| Forecast Integration |  | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |  |  |  |  |
| Supply Constraints |  | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |  |  |  |  |
| Governance & Cadence |  | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |  |  |  |  |
| Outcome KPIs |  | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |  |  |  |  |

### Suggested RAG rule

- **Green (🟢):** 80–100% of checks in area are “Yes”
- **Amber (🟡):** 40–79%
- **Red (🔴):** <40%

## 5) Recommended actions by maturity level

### Level 1 (0–5): Transactional/static

Priority actions (next 30–60 days):

1. Implement baseline safety stock + reorder point logic by SKU-location.
2. Establish segmentation (service level by item class/criticality).
3. Set monthly policy review and KPI baseline (service, turns, stockout, excess).

### Level 2 (6–11): Partial optimization

Priority actions (next 60–90 days):

1. Add lead-time variability and supplier risk into policy calculations.
2. Enforce constraint-aware recommendations (MOQ/lot/capacity aware).
3. Standardize exception management for stockout risk and excess risk.

### Level 3 (12–15): Mature foundation

Priority actions (next 90+ days):

1. Expand to scenario-based optimization for service/cash/cost trade-offs.
2. Introduce AI-assisted policy tuning and continuous learning loops.
3. Track financial outcomes in S&OP (working capital, obsolescence, expedite cost).

## 6) How this aligns with GenXChains

- **Demand module:** provides forecast + uncertainty inputs.
- **Supply module:** executes feasible replenishment/production under constraints.
- **Inventory module:** holds policy outputs and exceptions.
- **Scenarios + S&OP Cycle:** compare and approve service/cost/risk trade-offs.

This keeps IMS/ERP/WMS as the execution backbone while GenXChains drives planning intelligence and policy improvement.
